                <p>
                  On Chrome browsers the text inside the buttons were not centered. It was a
                  necessary visual and UI improvement.
                </p>
                <h4>How I changed it:</h4>
                <p>
                  Instead of using text align center I used align content center which solved the
                  problem.

                  When loading the products on the product page, there was no loading indicator.
                  This meant that users didn't know if there were no products to show or if they
                  were just waiting for products to load.
                </p>
                <h4>How I changed it:</h4>
                <p>
                  In the fetch function for the products page, I added a small loading indicator
                  which was removed after the request had been completed. As the site is called
                  rainy days I created a loader that looked like rain drops falling. I used purely
                  CSS to animate the drops. I created one animation and gave each raindrop a
                  different time frame making them look like they are dropping at random.

                  The contact form didn't work, it didn't send the information anywhere, it was just
                  a hard coded link to a mock confirmation page. I wanted to be able to send emails
                  from there.

                  I created a headless WordPress installation, added the
                  <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/">Contact-Form-7 </a>and
                  <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/flamingo/">Flamingo</a> plugins. I posted
                  the information from the contact form to the backend. I also added a small message
                  to tell the user when the message was being sent as there was a small delay from
                  pressing send to receiving the confirmation from the backend. After receiving
                  response.ok from the server the sending message was removed and replaced with a
                  message sent confirmation.

                  The website did not have a favicon visible at the tops of the pages. It is a nice
                  branding thing to have and is good for users to quickly recognise which tab they
                  are looking for.

                  I linked the favicon at the top of each HTML page giving it rel and type
                  attributes so the browser would know this was the icon to show in the tab.

                  There was a search input in the header of every page but it didn't have any
                  functionality. To make this a useful feature I needed to make it work properly.

                  Using the WooCommerce API endpoint for products, and adding a search query I was
                  able to display products matching the user input. To do this I created a function
                  that added the users search as a query string. This then redirected the user to
                  the search results page. I took the query string and used this in the search
                  endpoint to collect all products that matched the users search.

                  The pictures in the exhibitions page were static I thought it would be nice if
                  users could click on the images to see them full screen.

                <h4>How I changed it:</h4>
                <p>
                  I selected all the images on the page with .querySelectorAll(). I then used
                  forEach() to add an event listener to each of the images. I added a class that
                  would allow me to style the images to be full screen using CSS. I also added a
                  small close button so it was clear to users how to close the modal.

                  Instead oh hard coding all the exhibitions in the HTML I populated them from the
                  WordPress API. This not only helped with the search function but it also means if
                  exhibitions needed updating or changing this could easily be done, without needing
                  to add any extra code.

                  I originally had one page for mens and womens that linked to the same JavaScript
                  file and was a copy of all the same HTML. As you could filter gender on both the
                  pages anyway, the extra page was redundant. It could also get confusing when the
                  title of the page was stating womens jackets and you had filtered to only show
                  mens jackets.
                </p>
                <h4>How I changed it:</h4>
                <p>
                  I removed both the pages and made one page for "Jackets" instead. This gives the
                  ability to see mens or womens items using the filter. I then changed all the
                  links, titles and breadcrumb links accordingly. I then added query strings when a
                  user clicked on the mens or womens buttons on the home page. I used this to then
                  either check the correct filters and changed the page title to specify the gender
                  selected.

                  When the site was first made it was purely HTML and CSS. To make the menu, search
                  and basket open and close I originally used the checkbox hack. As this is not
                  really an ideal way to achieve this effect, semantically or for accessibility, it
                  needed to be changed.

                <h4>How I changed it:</h4>
                <p>
                  I removed all the checkbox hacks from the site and replaced the functionality with
                  a small amount of JavaScript. Adding and removing a specific class that is styled
                  accordingly.

                  The buttons had an on hover effect that lifted the button upwards by 10px. This
                  caused a flickering effect if you hovered over the bottom of the button.

                  Some of the elements on the site were not very semantic. For example I had a div
                  inside a label element to create the hamburger menu. There were also a number of
                  checkbox hacks used to create menus and search areas. This was not ideal
                  especially for people using assistive technology.

                  When I originally coded this site I used purely HTML and CSS. By adding JavaScript
                  I was able to remove the need for checkbox hacks. This eliminated the problem of
                  nesting div elements inside a label. I created a menu button element that added
                  and removed class names to the menu.

                  The contact form didn't work, it didn't send the information anywhere, it was just

                  I created a headless WordPress installation, added the
                  <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/">Contact-Form-7 </a>and
                  <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/flamingo/">Flamingo</a> plugins. I posted
                  the information from the contact form to the backend. I also added a small message
                  to tell the user when the message was being sent as there was a small delay from
                  pressing send to receiving the confirmation from the backend. After receiving
                  response.ok from the server the sending message was removed and replaced with a
                  message sent confirmation.

                  I added the exhibitions to the WordPress database so I could then very easily use
                  the search endpoint from the WordPress API to display exhibitions matching the
                  user input. To do this I created a function that added the users search as a query
                  string. This then redirected the user to the exhibitions page. I took the query
                  string and used this in the search endpoint to collect all exhibitions that
                  matched the users search.

                  I added event handlers to the images that increased the scale of the image using
                  transform scale(). This meant that when a user hovered over an image it zooms in.
                  I then added another event listener for mouse move, which allows the user to pan
                  over the image. To achieve the panning effect I simply offset the point where the
                  image was transformed, using the x and y positions of the cursor.

                  I found that some of the buttons lacked enough contrast to pass WCAG accessibility
                  tests. There were also a number of images without alt text, or with not very
                  useful alt text. I changed this to make the site more accessible to all different
                  types of user.

                  checked that all buttons and links had appropriate text and aria-labels where
                  necessary. I also thoroughly checked the contrast of the different elements on the

                  The buttons had an on hover effect that lifted the button upwards by 10px. This
                  caused a flickering effect if you hovered over the bottom of the button.

                  I changed the transform property from translatey() to use scale(). This removed
                  the flickering effect but still left the appearance of the button lifting off the

                  Some of the elements on the site were not very semantic. For example I had a div
                  inside a label element to create the hanburger menu. There were also a number of
                  checkbox hacks used to create menus and search areas. This was not ideal
                  especially for people using assistive technology.

                <p>
                  When I originally coded this site I used purely HTML and CSS. By adding JavaScript
                  I was able to remove the need for checkbox hacks. This eliminated the problem of
                  nesting div elements inside a label. I created a menu button element that added
                  and removed class names to the menu.

                <h4>Why I changed it:</h4>
                <p>
                  I found that some of the buttons lacked enough contrast to pass WCAG accessibility
                  tests. There were also a number of images without alt text, or with not very
                  useful alt text. I changed this to make the site more accessible to all different
                  types of user.

                <h4>How I changed it:</h4>
                <p>
                  I checked through all images and ensured there was a descriptive alt text. I also
                  checked that all buttons and links had appropriate text and aria-labels where
                  necessary. I also thoroughly checked the contrast of the different elements on the
                  site to ensure they would be readable for everyone.
