                <h4>Why I changed the buttons:</h4>
                <p>
                  On Chrome browsers the text inside the buttons were not centered. It was a
                  necessary visual and UI improvement.
                </p>
                <h4>How I changed the buttons:</h4>
                <p>
                  Instead of using text align center I used align content center which solved the
                  problem.

                <h4>Why I changed the loading indicator:</h4>
                <p>
                  When loading the products on the product page, there was no loading indicator.
                  This meant that users didn't know if there were no products to show or if they
                  were just waiting for products to load.
                </p>
                <h4>How I changed the loading indicator:</h4>
                <p>
                  In the fetch function for the products page, I added a small loading indicator
                  which was removed after the request had been completed. As the site is called
                  rainy days I created a loader that looked like rain drops falling. I used purely
                  CSS to animate the drops. I created one animation and gave each raindrop a
                  different time frame making them look like they are dropping at random.

                <h4>Why I changed the contact form:</h4>
                <p>
                  The contact form didn't work, it didn't send the information anywhere, it was just
                  a hard coded link to a mock confirmation page. I wanted to be able to send emails
                  from there.
                </p>
                <h4>How I changed the contact form:</h4>
                <p>
                  I created a headless WordPress installation, added the
                  <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/" target="_blank"
                    >Contact-Form-7 </a
                  >and
                  <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/flamingo/" target="_blank">Flamingo</a>
                  plugins. I posted the information from the contact form to the backend. I also
                  added a small message to tell the user when the message was being sent as there
                  was a small delay from pressing send to receiving the confirmation from the
                  backend. After receiving response.ok from the server the sending message was
                  removed and replaced with a message sent confirmation.

                <h4>Why I added a favicon:</h4>
                <p>
                  The website did not have a favicon visible at the tops of the pages. It is a nice
                  branding thing to have and is good for users to quickly recognise which tab they
                  are looking for.
                </p>
                <h4>How I added a favicon:</h4>
                <p>
                  I linked the favicon at the top of each HTML page giving it rel and type
                  attributes so the browser would know this was the icon to show in the tab.

              <div>
                <h4>Why I changed the search function:</h4>
                <p>
                  There was a search input in the header of every page but it didn't have any
                  functionality. To make this a useful feature I needed to make it work properly.
                </p>
                <h4>How I changed the search function:</h4>
                <p>
                  Using the WooCommerce API endpoint for products, and adding a search query I was
                  able to display products matching the user input. To do this I created a function
                  that added the users search as a query string. This then redirected the user to
                  the search results page. I took the query string and used this in the search
                  endpoint to collect all products that matched the users search.
                </p>

            <li class="proj-1_info-element">
              <div>
                <h4>Why I added image zoom:</h4>
                <p>
                  The pictures in the exhibitions page were static I thought it would be nice if
                  users could click on the images to see them full screen.
                </p>
                <h4>How I added image zoom:</h4>
                <p>
                  I selected all the images on the page with .querySelectorAll(). I then used
                  forEach() to add an event listener to each of the images. I added a class that
                  would allow me to style the images to be full screen using CSS. I also added a
                  small close button so it was clear to users how to close the modal.

                <p>
                  Instead oh hard coding all the exhibitions in the HTML I populated them from the
                  WordPress API. This not only helped with the search function but it also means if
                  exhibitions needed updating or changing this could easily be done, without needing
                  to add any extra code.

              <div>
                <h4>Why I changed the products page:</h4>
                <p>
                  I originally had one page for men's and women's that linked to the same JavaScript
                  file and was a copy of all the same HTML. As you could filter gender on both the
                  pages anyway, the extra page was redundant. It could also get confusing when the
                  title of the page was stating women's jackets and you had filtered to only show
                  mens jackets.
                </p>
                <h4>How I changed the products page:</h4>
                <p>
                  I removed both the pages and made one page for "Jackets" instead. This gives the
                  ability to see men's or women's items using the filter. I then changed all the
                  links, titles and breadcrumb links accordingly. I then added query strings when a
                  user clicked on the men's or women's buttons on the home page. I used this to then
                  either check the correct filters and changed the page title to specify the gender
                  selected.

                <h4>Why I removed the check-box hacks:</h4>
                <p>
                  When the site was first made it was purely HTML and CSS. To make the menu, search
                  and basket open and close I originally used the checkbox hack. As this is not
                  really an ideal way to achieve this effect, semantically or for accessibility, it
                  needed to be changed.
                </p>
                <h4>How I removed the check-box hacks:</h4>
                <p>
                  I removed all the checkbox hacks from the site and replaced the functionality with
                  a small amount of JavaScript. Adding and removing a specific class that is styled
                  accordingly.

                <p>
                  The buttons had an on hover effect that lifted the button upwards by 10px. This
                  caused a flickering effect if you hovered over the bottom of the button.

                <h4>How I changed the buttons:</h4>
                <p>
                  I changed the transform property from translatey() to use scale(). This removed
                  the flickering effect but still left the appearance of the button lifting off the
                  page.

                <p>
                  Some pages had links to take you to various sections of the page. The page hopped
                  instantly to the new place on the page, it wasn't very comfortable on the eyes.
                </p>
                <h4>How I changed the scroll behaviour:</h4>
                <p>
                  I added a scroll-behaviour smooth to the whole document so the users can move from
                  place to place on a page in a more pleasant manner.

                <h4>Why I changed the semantics:</h4>
                <p>
                  Some of the elements on the site were not very semantic. For example I had a div
                  inside a label element to create the hamburger menu. There were also a number of
                  checkbox hacks used to create menus and search areas. This was not ideal
                  especially for people using assistive technology.
                </p>
                <h4>How I changed the semantics:</h4>
                <p>
                  When I originally coded this site I used purely HTML and CSS. By adding JavaScript
                  I was able to remove the need for checkbox hacks. This eliminated the problem of
                  nesting div elements inside a label. I created a menu button element that added
                  and removed class names to the menu.

                <p>
                  The contact form didn't work, it didn't send the information anywhere, it was just
                  a hard coded link to a mock confirmation page. I wanted to be able to send emails
                  from there.
                </p>
                <h4>How I changed the contact form:</h4>
                <p>
                  I created a headless WordPress installation, added the
                  <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/" target="_blank"
                    >Contact-Form-7 </a

                  <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/flamingo/" target="_blank">Flamingo</a>
                  plugins. I posted the information from the contact form to the backend. I also
                  added a small message to tell the user when the message was being sent as there
                  was a small delay from pressing send to receiving the confirmation from the
                  backend. After receiving response.ok from the server the sending message was
                  removed and replaced with a message sent confirmation.

                  As I now had a form that was able to send I wanted to be able to validate the user
                  inputs before sending the information to make sure it was all correct.

                <h4>How I changed the form validation:</h4>
                <p>
                  Using JavaScript I was able to create form validation that checked the user input.
                  I created an event listener on focusout to tell the user immediately if there was
                  an error. This allowed them to fill in the form more easily as they could correct
                  mistakes as they went through.

                <p>
                  There was a search input in the header of every page but it didn't have any
                  functionality. To make this a useful feature I needed to make it work properly

                <p>
                  I added the exhibitions to the WordPress database so I could then very easily use
                  the search endpoint from the WordPress API to display exhibitions matching the
                  user input. To do this I created a function that added the users search as a query
                  string. This then redirected the user to the exhibitions page. I took the query
                  string and used this in the search endpoint to collect all exhibitions that
                  matched the users search.

                  The pictures on the product were static and dod not allow users to view the image
                  larger, to see more details on the clothing.

                <h4>How I changed the picture modal:</h4>
                <p>
                  I added event handlers to the images that increased the scale of the image using
                  transform scale(). This meant that when a user hovered over an image it zooms in.
                  I then added another event listener for mouse move, which allows the user to pan
                  over the image. To achieve the panning effect I simply offset the point where the
                  image was transformed, using the x and y positions of the cursor.

                  Instead oh hard coding all the exhibitions in the HTML I populated them from the
                  WordPress API. This not only helped with the search function but it also means if
                  exhibitions needed updating or changing this could easily be done, without needing
                  to add any extra code.

                  I found that some of the buttons lacked enough contrast to pass WCAG accessibility
                  tests. There were also a number of images without alt text, or with not very
                  useful alt text. I changed this to make the site more accessible to all different
                  types of user.

                  I checked through all images and ensured there was a descriptive alt text. I also
                  checked that all buttons and links had appropriate text and aria-labels where
                  necessary. I also thoroughly checked the contrast of the different elements on the
                  site to ensure they would be readable for everyone.

                <p>
                  I realised on sending the form that users hesitated and wondered why the form
                  hadn't reset yet. I was displaying send before resetting the form that happened
                  when the message had actually been sent. This was confusing to users.

                <p>
                  I added the loader animation that I used on other pages and changed the text to
                  display sending... this was a much clearer indicator to users what was currently
                  going on. They could then wait to recieve a sending success message or failed if
                  the message was unable to send.

                  I realised on larger screens users were missing the small links positioned to the
                  far right. To help users find links and navigate easier it was necessary to
                  position these more visibly.

                <h4>How I changed the footer design:</h4>
                <p>
                  I used display flex to position the links in the center of the footer and
                  justified them with space between so they would be evenly spaced out. I also added
                  a small dividing line to clearly separate the outside (social media links) from
                  the links to other pages on the blog. I also added small separators between the
                  links to separate them visually from one another.

                  I therefore wanted to increase the line height to space out the lines a little.

                  that some blocks of text were very spread out and others crammed together. I found
                  that I could set line height as a percentage which fixed the problem, and spaced
                  text nicely.

                  In my original design I had placed a button on the about page that would take the
                  user to a random blog post. I had been unable to achieve this in the original
                  project so I wanted to add this feature.

                  >
                  to the plugin folder of my wordpress site. This added an endpoint that would fetch
                  posts in a totally random order. By fetching just one post at a time I was then
                  able to collect a random post id. Using an on click event listener I sent the user
                  to the blog post page with the random id. If there was an error in the fetch
                  request I then linked the user to a specific blog post page.

                  where the buttons were darker in colour.

                <h4>How I changed selected filter button styling:</h4>
                <p>
                  In the in the on click event handler, I changed the colours of each of the filter
                  buttons borders. I chose colours that contrasted well. For accessibility I also
                  added an underline to the filter that had been chosen. This made it much more
                  obvious at a quick glance.

                <h4>Why I changed the scroll function in the carousel:</h4>
                <p>
                  Users were required to click many times to scroll from one end of the carousel to
                  another. I noticed from the HotJar recordings that some users were clicking and
                  holding to scroll. I thought this would be a nice feature as it would save users
                  some clicks.
                </p>
                <h4>How I changed the scroll function the carousel:</h4>
                <p>
                  Instead of the on click event listener I added a mouse up and down for each arrow
                  on the carousel. This allowed me to set a variable as pressed or not pressed. I
                  then used setInterval() to increase or decrease the scroll position depending on
                  which arrow is pressed. I got a user to test this and adjusted the speed so it
                  felt comfortable to scroll, not too slow or fast. I added a clearInterval function
                  when a user removed the mouse from the arrow or stopped clicking. Now a user can
                  scroll with click and click and press.

                <p>
                  I realised that to render the carousel there was a large amount of duplicated
                  code. This is not very good practice and needed to be cleaned up.
                </p>
                <h4>How I cleaned up the code:</h4>
                <p>
                  I took the variables for selecting the carousel components and moved this and the
                  event listeners to the script.js page. This allowed me to delete 414 lines of code
                  in total.

                <h4>Why I changed the social media links:</h4>
                <p>
                  The social media icons in the footer linked to the respective websites but didn't
                  have the functionality to share the blog website which is what I had originally
                  intended. I therefore wanted to add this feature. I had also originally linked
                  Instagram and Snapchat in the footer but realised these platforms are better for
                  sharing photos not websites.
                </p>
                <h4>How I changed the social media links:</h4>
                <p>
                  Firstly I changed Instagram and Snapchat to LinkedIn and Pinterest, places where
                  people more commonly share websites. I then used
                  <a href="https://curiosum.com/tools/social-share-links-generator" target="_blank"
                    >Curiosum</a
                  >
                  to generate social media share links for my website.

                <h4>Why I changed the loader styling:</h4>
                <p>
                  I found that after I had increased the size of the blog post previews for larger
                  screens I had failed to increase the size of the loading animation. This caused
                  there to be an unsightly white band down the right hand side during loading.
                </p>
                <h4>How I changed the loader styling:</h4>
                <p>
                  I changed the width of the loader to be 100% so it filled the preview box. I then
                  changed the animation from % to px so the magnifying glass would still be in time
                  with the bug.
